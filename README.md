## Features

The calculator app offers the following features:

- Addition: Add two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
- Division: Divide one number by another.
- Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.
- Percentage: Calculate the percentage of a number.
- Power: Raise a number to a given power.
- Power of Two: Calculate the square of a number.
- Power of Three: Calculate the cube of a number.
- One Divided by X: Calculate the reciprocal of a number.
- Pi Number: Insert the value of pi (π).
- Ten to the Power of X: Calculate 10 raised to the power of a given number.
- Factorial: Calculate the factorial of a number.
- Modulus: Calculate the remainder of a division operation.
- Mode Change: Switch between portrait and landscape orientations.
- Plus/Minus: Change the sign of a number.
- Trigonometric Functions: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of a given angle.
- Natural Logarithm (ln): Calculate the natural logarithm of a number.
- Logarithm (log): Calculate the logarithm of a number.

## Installation

To use the calculator app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/kalkulatorv1.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

Once the app is installed and launched on an Android device or emulator, you can perform the following actions:

- Enter numbers: Tap on the number buttons (0-9) to enter numeric values.
- Perform calculations: Tap on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic calculations.
- Calculate square roots: Tap on the square root button (√) to calculate the square root of a number.
- Calculate percentages: Tap on the percentage button (%) to calculate the percentage of a number.
- Raise to a power: Tap on the power button (^) to raise a number to a given power.
- Calculate factorial: Tap on the factorial button (!) to calculate the factorial of a number.
- Change sign: Tap on the plus/minus button (±) to change the sign of a number.
- Calculate trigonometric functions: Tap on the sine (sin), cosine (cos), or tangent (tan) buttons to calculate the corresponding trigonometric function of an angle.
- Calculate logarithms: Tap on the natural logarithm (ln) or logarithm (log) buttons to calculate the corresponding logarithm of a number.
- Change orientation: Tap on the mode change button to switch between portrait and landscape orientations.

## Development

The calculator app is developed using Android and Kotlin. It utilizes the `exp4j` library for evaluating mathematical expressions.

The main components of the app are:

- `MainActivity`: The main activity class that handles the user interface and user interactions.
- `activity_main.xml`: The layout file for the main activity in portrait orientation.
- `activity_main_land.xml`: The layout file for the main activity in landscape orientation.
